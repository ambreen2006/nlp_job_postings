Affirm is reinventing credit to make it more honest and friendly, giving consumers the flexibility to buy now and pay later without any hidden fees or compounding interest.

Affirm’s data science team solves problems critical to Affirm’s business model - detecting fraud and assessing creditworthiness in real time. Affirm’s innovative products ensure that we cannot use off-the-shelf modeling algorithms and must create novel data science solutions to drive both existing and new products. At some point during almost every project you work on, you will think: “I thought this was going to be straightforward, it is not!”. Some of the routine challenges we face are:
How do we experiment, when each experiment can cost us significant dollars?
- How do we detect that an identity is stolen - in real time?How do we underwrite users with short credit histories?How do we do all of the above in < 100 ms?What if analyses: how will a borrower behave if the market crashes?How do you predict consumer lifetime value when you don’t observe it?

THINGS YOU'LL DO

Build production models that underpin new and existing products. You own the end-to-end workflow of designing, developing, and deploying machine learning models. You coordinate with product managers, engineers, and even legal teams. Design experiments and analyze data. Your ad-hoc data analyses will decide which policies we adopt, where we expand our business, and which products we create.
WHAT PROBLEMS YOU'LL SOLVE
Active Learning: How do you design a system where a manual review of transactions is expensive?
Reject Inference: How do you learn about the performance of the population that the model rejects?
Design of experiments: Can we continue to learn without losing our shirt?
Conduct ad-hoc data analyses: your analyses will decide which policies we adopt, where we expand our business, and which products we create.
Plan, get feedback, create, iterate, deploy.
Own the DS workflow end-to-end, from idea to production.
WHAT WE LOOK FOR
Advanced degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Math, Physics, Econometrics, or a related quantitative field
PhD with 3+ years industry experience, 5+ years with a MS, or 7+ years with a BS
Experience being a tech lead in a data science group
Proficiency in machine learning algorithms such as gradient boosting, deep learning, recommendation systems, reinforcement learning, anomaly detection, and markov decision processes
Strong programming skills in a scientific computing language such as Python. Experience using frameworks for machine learning and data science like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, xgboost, TensorFlow
Experience writing production level code for data pipelines and real time applications, object-oriented programming, and contributing to a large code repository
Experience with big data technologies such as Spark, Hive, Hadoop, EMR, etc
Excellent written and oral communication skills with cross-functional product and engineering teams to develop requirements, and present technical concepts and results
Nice to have: demonstrated communication and involvement in the data science and ML community via blog posts, papers or conference talks
Persistence and patience and a great sense of responsibility - we create the decisioning that drives Affirm’s business!
If you got to this point, we hope you're feeling excited about the job description you just read. Even if you don't feel that you meet every single requirement, we still encourage you to apply. We're eager to meet people that believe in Affirm's mission and can contribute to our team in a variety of ways – not just candidates who check all the boxes.

Create the model that transforms how real estate deals close
Want to infuse a $20B sector of the insurance and real estate industry with predictive analytics and a tech-forward customer experience? Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.
It’s no secret the housing market has peaked. Lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to ride the down market and boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they’re used to in terms of speed and value.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction needs our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.
Our streamlined, efficient algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company on January 7th. With a broader nationwide footprint, we are poised to transform this industry, repurposing the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

We're growing our data science team
As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at PayPal, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them.

We're looking for a Junior Data Scientist to help us start the next chapter of data science initiatives at Ranker.

Ranker is the top destination for votable content on the internet. Our highly engaged visitors consistently generate 50 million upvotes and downvotes on practically everything in pop culture. All that voting translates into a tremendous amount of psychographic data, revealing consumer tastes in everything from movies, to TV, to music, to sports, to brands. We want to turn all this data into something that studios, networks, and brands can use to guide their decisions, and we need your help to do it.

As a Junior Data Scientist, you would play a huge role in determining how this data is leveraged and packaged. Our ideal candidate will have a solid foundation in research methods and statistics, but because we’re building something entirely new, you’ll need to apply that knowledge to answer questions that may not be neatly framed. You’ll help to build APIs, perform analyses, develop user-facing products, and more.

You don’t have to worry about a “cold start” — Ranker already has the data infrastructure and talented engineering team you need to get to work immediately, and your work will be directed by a Senior Data Scientist. Our data is structured and ready for analysis, allowing you to start digging into consumer tastes and building sophisticated models that studios, brands, and marketers can use to inform data-driven decisions and campaigns.

We’re already expanding beyond our growing core media business and building offshoot products in both the B2B and B2C space. Much of your work will be centered around building these products, taking Ranker’s IP and building it into new tools. Our current budding projects include a TV/movie recommendation app and a B2B business around psychographic insights.

Based in the heart of Los Angeles and established 10 years ago, the company is solidly profitable and has 80+ employees and growing.

What You’ll Do:

Translate business requirements into research components and data requirements
Provide detailed analysis that will uncover new insights and identify new sales, marketing, and growth opportunities
Transform complex analyses into compelling, easy-to-understand case studies and user stories
Maintain and improve upon existing models and tools for internal marketing and sales teams.

What You’ll Need:

Master’s degree (Ph.D. preferred) in statistics, computer science, mathematics, data science, or other quantitative science (psychology, economics, physics, etc.)
4+ years of relevant work experience in statistics, data science, or machine learning (or Ph.D. in a quantitative field)
A passion for using data to tell stories and using visualization tools to help unlock meaningful insights.
The ability to interpret and communicate complex concepts clearly to non-technical team members
Experience with quantitative analysis
A solid understanding of statistics and a demonstrated ability to understand the statistical basis of crowdsourcing
Programming and scripting skills (SQL, PHP, R, Python, etc.)
Knowledge of modern (tensorflow, keras, and pytorch) machine learning algorithms (clustering, regression, classification, optimization)
Demonstrable experience in research methodology

You Will Enjoy The Role If:

You get excited about taking ownership of problems and solving them in a fast-paced and scrappy environment, working cross-functionally with both technical and non-technical people
You want a strong data infrastructure and engineering team to back you up, rather than having to start from scratch
You are output-focused and see data science as a powerful tool to get things done, rather than as an end in itself
You are a strong critical thinker with a passion for understanding complex issues and are comfortable working on ambiguous problems
Your passion and curiosity for data is infectious

We don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.

Nehemiah Security is in search of Mid to Senior level Data Scientist. The data scientist will be responsible for creating models that pertain to our customers’ vulnerability to cyber attack given technical details of how the customer’s technology infrastructure is set up; and models that pertain to how a customer’s business is financially exposed to an attacker exploiting those vulnerabilities. The Data Scientist will report to the Global Chief Technology Officer.
In order to make the models relevant to a specific customer, the successful candidate will have to work with data that considers the current cyber threat environment globally, the customer’s exposure to those threats (in terms of their technology infrastructure’s configuration) and the financial losses that those threats could cause. Since the models are of a range of possible attacks, considering the personality and motivation of the attacker, as well as the possible responses from the company, the models must produce a range of outputs at different probabilities.

The Buzz on Nehemiah Security

Nehemiah Security is a fast-growing cybersecurity software company with a passion for building great software. We are leading the way in transforming how companies manage their cyber risk. Here’s what’s important to us: our people, adding value to our customers, innovation, creativity, hard work, persistence, fearlessness, speed, passion, faith, and teamwork.

Rated as one of the top 25 best places to work in the Washington DC area, Nehemiah Security is an awesome company to join that can help launch and define your career.


What You’ll Do
Designing models that can produce both the magnitude and probability of a company losing money due to multiple cyber events
Designing models that can produce both the magnitude and probability of a company incurring indirect, longer term losses related to reputation damage
Designing sensitivity models that can capture the financial effect of the theft of an organization’s secrets
Working with the other members of the data science team to build a complete set of models that consider the types of attack, the personalities and motivations of the attacker, the customer infrastructure’s resilience to those attacks and the response of the defenders within the customer
Working with the developers and subject matter experts in cybersecurity, IT and business infrastructure in order to design and specify the required inputs to any models, and how to go about gathering them from the customer’s environment or the global threat landscape
Working with the development and architecture teams to take proof of concept models and productise them
Working with the QA team to ensure that the outputs of models can be tested and validated when in production
This is a research role – the models that are built as part of this job will go into production in the RQ product. There are significant challenges to overcome in building models that will operate both in a realistic challenge and can operate at scale.

What We Are Looking For In You

A strong background in mathematics (ideally with focus on probability, linear algebra and graph theory)
Experience in building mathematical models of complex systems
The ability to communicate with SMEs in both the technical and business spaces
Experience working with programming languages such as Python, R, Mathematica, or MATLAB

Why Clarity Insights, Why Consulting and Why Now?

We don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.


Clarity Insights is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer. We believe in treating each employee and applicant for employment fairly and with dignity.

Corelight is an early-stage security startup based in downtown San Francisco and Columbus, OH. We secure some of the most sensitive and mission-critical networks in the world, and our rapidly-growing customer base includes eight of the Fortune 50. Based on the Zeek (formerly Bro) Network Security Monitor, a beloved and widely used open-source framework, Corelight Sensors transform high-volume network traffic into 'rocket fuel' for security analytics and operations. Following in the footsteps of successful open-source security companies such as Sourcefire and Tenable, Corelight's unfair market advantages include its founders: the inventor of Zeek and its key open-source committers. Join Corelight, and help us make the world's networks safer.

--------------------
Role and Opportunity
--------------------

We are building a world class and uniquely targeted team to drive research through data science. Key team members will use their strong data science skills, coupled with an enthusiasm to learn about a wide range of data-intensive analysis problems in the network security domain, to drive novel, durable, and effective threat identification. You will furthermore work with colleagues to define and build the data science technology stack needed both to grow the team and to enable new data-driven insights in a domain with unique opportunities and challenges. Finally, because Corelight can define the data our sensors generate, you will have a role in shaping how we extend the data itself to enable new types of analysis as needed. You will be able to look back a year from now and say two things with pride: first, ""I helped build that from the ground up"", and second, ""we are generating insight that no one else in the world has achieved.""

------------

Opportunity:
------------


Work with Vern Paxson (creator of Zeek, UC Berkeley Professor and world renowned network security researcher) and with mentorship from Richard Bejtlich (famed threat defense thought leader)
Develop algorithms to identify activity buried within torrents of highly structured data
Identify apt opportunities to apply supervised and unsupervised techniques to robustly identify a wealth of behaviors, in the face of a range of real-world constraints
Specify improvements to the data itself (new / different parsers, data augmentation, etc.) that will enable unique insights and superior threat detection
Drive advances in the analytics tools and frameworks (across structured detection algorithms, machine learning, NLP, behavioral analysis, etc.) both for our growing threat research team and for the Corelight Sensor to create and execute your models
Author key materials to share (a) detection insights with the security community, and (b) guide analysts in employing the models you develop.

---------------

Qualifications:
---------------


MS with 5+ years experience or PhD in computer science, or similar computational discipline, e.g. statistics, mathematics, physics (or equivalent experience)
Analysis: Strong data science skills, including a proven track record applying the techniques to real-world Big Data problems. Extensive experience with tools and environments such as R, Pandas, Matlab/Octave, Tensorflow, Spark.
Knowledge of practical networking, security, and their intersection is highly beneficial - but can be offset by enthusiasm to learn about these domains from highly experienced experts.

--------------------
A note on experience
--------------------

We understand that no candidate is perfectly qualified for any job. Experience comes in different forms; many skills are transferable; and passion goes a long way. Even more important than your resume is clear demonstration of skill, dedication, and the ability to thrive in a fluid and collaborative environment. We want you to learn new things in this role, and we encourage you to apply if your experience is close to what we're looking for.

Diversity of background and thought makes for better problem solving and more creative thinking, which is why we're dedicated to adding new perspectives to the team.

At Optoro, we build software to help us solve this problem. We have tools that manage inventory in both ours and client warehouses, visualization and reports showing clients how much value they are getting out of their excess inventory, and entire eCommerce platforms and integrations to get these products into new and appreciative hands.

Core to our value is the ability to capture and analyze the vast amount of data that flows through our system from the millions of units we handle. We transform this data into action in order to more efficiently and effectively route returned items to their optimal home. We use smart algorithms to drive every piece of this journey, from initial quality assessment, to packing, to routing, to pricing (and repricing). Ultimately, we ensure that intelligent, data-driven decisions are made at every point in process.

We employ any and all tools necessary to accomplish our mission whether it be simple linear regression, the latest deep learning models, or hierarchical Bayesian inference. While we work primarily in Python, we don't hesitate to dive into the underlying product code when needed. We hire people not only based on what they already know, but based on what they are learning and their hunger to deliver and to keep expanding their skills!

At Afresh, we’re solving the big problems around food waste and the fresh food supply chain-focusing first in grocery. We use cutting-edge AI (we’ve been published in ICML!) combined with thoughtful design to enhance decision-making and optimize store workflows. The results are powerful: in live deployments in grocery stores, we have demonstrated the potential to double profits and reduce food waste by 50%+!
What will you be doing?
Performing analyses over billions of historical data points collected from across the food supply chain to find actionable patterns and improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.
Designing experiments for assessing the performance of machine learning algorithms. Proposing improvements to our core machine learning engine.
Deriving insights from customer data and communicating findings. Assessing the integrity of data and recommending solutions to integrity problems.
Overseeing the implementation of data pipelines within modern big data processing systems such as Spark and Hadoop.
Building visualization and data exploration tools that automate the analysis and debugging of machine learning models.
What skills do you need?
Masters or PhD in statistics, computer science, or equivalent.
4+ years of work experience.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
Deep knowledge of statistical techniques, including clustering and unsupervised learning, predictive modeling, non-parametric statistics.
Excellent technical communication skills. Ability to use visualization tools to perform investigative work and communicate results.
Proficiency with the Python data science stack, including numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib. Strong knowledge of SQL.
Experience with engineering machine learning systems is a big plus. Experience with modern big data systems such as Apache Spark or Hadoop is a big plus.
Background

About 30-40% of food produced worldwide is thrown away, causing nearly a trillion dollars of economic losses, trillions of gallons of wasted water, and billions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions. In the US, about 40% of all food waste occurs at the retail level and downstream, largely driven by insufficient technology and manual processes.

Afresh seeks to tackle some of these big problems around food waste. Born out of Stanford's Computer Science PhD program, Afresh is the first Fresh food supply chain company. We bring the cutting edge of artificial intelligence to Fresh food to minimize food waste.

Our machine learning-powered supply chain solutions are tailored for the nuances of perishables. Our first product is a store-level replenishment tool that optimizes the ordering of items in Fresh categories - produce, meat, deli, dairy, bakery, and prepared foods. The goal is to minimize waste and maximize in-stock rate, and consequently, profit.

So far, the results are awesome! Like we said above, in live deployments, we have demonstrated the potential to double profits and reduce food waste by 50%+.

We're growing fast: we're in partnership with 4 large regional grocers representing 500+ stores and >$10B in revenue. Our backers include Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm) and Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitchfix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram).

Help the world spend their time with intention.
*****************************************************

Ping builds automation tools for professional services. We're starting by automating timekeeping for the world's largest enterprises and then using that data to transform the way these industries price, operate and work. Professionals won't just use our system to manage their time but to create it.

And we need your help.

****************
Our Vision
****************

We believe that time is the most valuable thing we can spend. We also believe that professionals are wasting a staggering amount of time at work because they have no idea where they are spending it. Previously, professionals had to manually record every six-minutes of their day into antiquated timekeeping software. We are automating this workflow so professionals can concentrate on creating value, not being administrators.

And that's just the beginning. We will then leverage the data we collect to optimize the way work is priced and performed across these trillion-dollar industries. If done correctly, we'll allow professionals to output in 4 hours what now takes them 10. This gives you an opportunity to impact the world at scale - give people back time they'd otherwise lose forever and empower them to spend it with intention.

In business for 30 years, AVAST is one of the oldest companies in the computer security business, with a portfolio covering everything from free antivirus for PC, Mac, and Android, to premium suites and services for business – offered in about 40 languages.
Headquartered in Prague, Czech Republic, with offices in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, AVAST Software employs some of the brightest new talent in the IT industry, from around 30 different nations.
The position is based in Redwood City and Emeryville, CA
About Avast Intelligence Lab:
Avast is expanding its reach to secure all home IoT devices. Homes are the new frontier for security, with millions of IoT devices connected and accessible on the internet. Many of these devices have old software and are rarely patched. In addition, most IoT devices do not allow installation of endpoint security software. The challenge for Avast is to protect these vulnerable devices while only observing them on the home network!
Today, the world’s home networks typically consist of a local wifi managed by a home gateway that connects to an ISP network via cable or DSL. As the world moves to 5G, the connectivity of consumer homes is expected to undergo a paradigm shift. The softwarization of the telecom networks will reach into our homes. Much of the home gateway functionality will move to the edge of the telco network, where it will be reborn as software-defined virtual network functions. Moreover, the home networks will have the flexibility to connect via various access technologies such as fiber, cable, and radio links giving rise to the 5G converged core network.
The future of home IoT security in the 5G architecture plays to Avast’s strength since security is a key differentiator for telecom operators plan to provide security as a software virtual function. As such, the technical challenge for Avast is to implement machine learning based solutions in the edge cloud to analyze and verify network traffic. In case of a security breach, countermeasures need to be triggered automatically. Machine learning is the key piece of the solution as most home networks are not administered by their owners and intelligent automation is the only way to protect millions of smart homes.
Avast has conceived an architecture to achieve a ‘Best in the World’ Home IoT Security solution for a 5G deployment. We are building a series of PoCs and trials to validate our solution with operators under real world conditions.
About You :
We are looking for a Data Scientist to help us protect IoT devices in homes around the world.
Focus of the team will be to analyze the security of devices within a home, by looking at network traffic inside and outside the home. The solutions will be deployed in production servers across many countries and continents, thus an exciting challenge is to handle the diversity of networks, homes and devices. The role has three focus areas: networking, machine learning, and edge cloud. Networking expertise is needed to produce telemetry data and understand vulnerabilities on the network level, machine learning to develop solutions to protect networks, and edge cloud to deploy and scale them.
Responsibilities:
Work with network architects to define and specify detailed tasks
Applying network security techniques to home IoT traffic
Interoperability with telco networking stacks
Applying supervised and unsupervised algorithms to generate better insights
Having fun in creating new and crazy ideas!

Languages: Python, SQL, R (occasionally you will also work with Node.js or Scala)
Storage: Postgres, Redshift, S3
Compute: Spark, Athena, EC2
Workflow Management: Airflow
Misc: Looker, Github, Jira, Splunk, PagerDuty

Responsibilities


Creatively use new and existing data to increase the efficiency of our underwriting infrastructure
Work with engineers to design machine learning solutions that operate quickly and effectively at scale. You will be involved in deploying models within Python microservices.
Make recommendations to the executive and cross-functional teams that would help improve Earnest operations.
Write tooling or expand on existing internal frameworks (e.g., feature-generator repo).

Why Clarity Insights, Why Consulting and Why Now?

We don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We’re not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.


Clarity Insights is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer. We believe in treating each employee and applicant for employment fairly and with dignity.

You've been calling your member of Congress and pleaded with your friends to do the same, even though deep down you're not sure it makes that much of a difference. You'll vote for the forward-thinking candidate this year, but you just wish there was something else you could do. There is.

In early 2017, we were in your shoes. But then we figured out how we could quickly, affordably, and accurately measure public opinion online - and we knew we could bring it to forward-thinking candidates and causes and help them win.

We're working on some really interesting problems with data, social science, and politics. And by solving them, we hope to make our democracy better.

We are currently accepting applications for a Data Scientist with expertise in Natural Language Processing. We encourage all qualified applicants, including people of color, gays and lesbians, women, transgender people, veterans, and people with disabilities. We particularly encourage people who are underrepresented in politics and startups to apply. We prioritize equity and inclusion. We recognize that diversity of perspectives and experiences makes our work better.

About the Role:
As a Data Scientist with expertise in Natural Language Processing, you’ll be involved in all aspects of our analytics, research, model development, and data pipeline. We’re a small but growing company and each team member contributes in a meaningful way. We interview millions of voters through our platform - a novel dataset with tremendous utility for political campaigns. Your role will be focused on turning unstructured public opinion into empirical conclusions.

In your first weeks:
Expected skills: best-in-class facility with Python (preferably) and/or R (acceptable) as well as SQL; team-based experience with Github; experience applying Natural Language Processing models in an industrial setting.
Example project: classifying topics within a sample of open-ended survey responses
What you’ll learn: the technology we’ve developed to help campaigns win
By the end of the year, as campaigns are just gearing up for 2020:
Expected skills: complete familiarity with our codebase and tech stack, so that you can commit production-ready code
Example project: create automatic features from open-ended text to be used in other models
What you’ll learn: how campaigns use (or don’t yet use) data; an intimate knowledge of our amassed polling data, including political attitudes across the country
In 2020 and Beyond:
Expected skills: solve novel problems, and formulate your own product ideas that anticipate problems before they come up. Write code that rivals that of a senior engineer, and introduce new modeling techniques to the team.
Example project: design an ensemble of models that can process a broad range of answers to open-ended questions like “What do you think of your Congresswoman?” or “What is the biggest issue unaddressed by your local government”?
What you’ll learn: How to be part of a growing data science team, contributing both ideas and technical prowess. Become an integral part of our data science operation and help the company grow its impact in Democratic politics
A successful member of our team will demonstrate the curiosity to try new things, but the self-discipline to prize results over technique. We’re open to hiring for a range of levels. The specific job will be commensurate with a candidate’s work experience and potential. Political experience is not required, but if you don’t have a passion for it you might burn out.

Compensation and work environment:
Ensuring a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other is core to our values. We invite folks with different backgrounds, experiences, abilities, and perspectives. Our workplace is both casual and professional, and we are committed to learning, fun, and excellence. We are an equal opportunity employer. This full-time position includes equity, health, dental and vision insurance, commuter benefits, flexible PTO, and company holidays.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.

A fulfillment center can appear to be a chaotic place. With millions of items moving in and out of an area twice as large as your average theme park every day, a quick peek under the roof would reveal a manic scene. You would see associates, machinery, vehicles, robots, and packages flying about at break-neck speeds and accessing a breathtaking number of shelves and bins that store products. In reality, however, this activity is all highly organized and orchestrated by software, with each movement carefully planned and optimized. However, there are times when mistakes occur: products may disappear, reappear in strange places, become damaged, or worse. When that happens, how does a fulfillment center operating at that size, speed, and scale recover gracefully and with minimal cost? How do we ensure that we meet our commitments to our customers and merchants? How do we find a needle in a haystack when we’re constantly shuffling the haystack around? And how do we do it at extreme scale in an environment of constant growth?

That’s where we come in, the AFT Inventory Entropy Management team. Our goal is to prevent entropy in a system in which there are billions of transactions driven by human and robotic input across hundreds of millions of items every year. We must ensure that the virtual and physical state of the world is aligned inside hundreds of Amazon’s fulfillment centers globally. When our job is done well mistakes are corrected quickly, and products are always ready to sell and ship.

We operate at a nexus of machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and healthy measure of hard-earned expertise in operations to build automated, algorithmic approaches to solving these problems at minimal cost. We create cutting edge software, building automated processes and workflows in the most complex operational problem space in the business world. So what should you expect from this role?

Major responsibilities: As a Data Scientist you will be working in one of the world's largest and most complex data analytics environments. You should have deep expertise in analyzing huge data sets from multiple domains. You should be expert at designing and implementing solutions that use a range of data science methodologies to automate data analysis or to solve complex business problems. You will design metrics for complex systems. You will deep dive ML training data and feature sets to drive improvements. You will partner with Research and Applied Scientists, SDEs, Technical Program Managers, Product Managers, and business leaders to identify solutions to large problems in Amazon Operations.

Your analysis and solution recommendations will drive system optimizations with global impact. You will develop metrics to quantify the benefits of a solution and influence project resources. You will audit metric data and use it to measure system impact and performance.

You will harness massive and diverse data sets to mine actionable insights for senior leaders. You will automate data feeds, validate the data input and analyze trends that lead to cost saving initiatives. In this role, you will own solving problems through deep data review, statistical analyses, and creation of analytic tools usable by others on the team. Your work products will guide our reporting, benchmarking, program optimization, financial planning, and execution strategy.

The ideal candidate is a motivated self-starter who can thrive in a fast paced environment. They will enjoy working in a multidisciplinary team of engineers, scientists and business leaders. They will seek to understand processes behind data so their recommendations are grounded.
